# Week 1 - Disease Detection with Computer Vision
In this week, we will practice classifying diseases on chest x-rays images using a neural network.

`C1_W1_Lab_1_data_exploration_and_image_preprocessing.ipynb`: In this first lab, we'll get a chance to explore the [ChestX-ray8 dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315) and familiarize ourselves with some of the techniques we'll use in the first graded assignment.

`C1_W1_Lab_2_counting_labels_and_weighted_loss_function.ipynb`: In this second lab, we learn how to use the weighted loss technique to deal with the class imbalance problem which often occur in medical datasets. 

`C1_W1_Lab_3_densenet.ipynb`: In this short lab, we briefly walk through [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993.pdf) - the convolutional network that we are going to use for X-ray image classification in the assignment.
