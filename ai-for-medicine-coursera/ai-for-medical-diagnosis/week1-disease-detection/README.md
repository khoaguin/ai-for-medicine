# Week 1 - Disease Detection with Computer Vision
In this week, we will practice classifying diseases on chest x-rays images using a neural network.

`C1_W1_Lab_1_data_exploration_and_image_preprocessing.ipynb`: In this first lab, we'll get a chance to explore the [ChestX-ray8 dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315) and familiarize ourselves with some of the techniques we'll use in the first graded assignment.
