# Week 2 - Evaluating Models
In this week, we will practice implementing standard evaluation metrics to see how well a model performs in diagnosing diseases.

## Labs
### [Lab 01: ROC Curve & Threshold](./C1_W2_Lab_1_roc_curve%20_and_threshold.ipynb)
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) is one of the most useful tools to evaluate medical models. It aims to measure the quality of a *binary estimator*, as it considers how the estimator is able to split between both classes, as we *vary the decision threshold*. In this lab, we will learn about the curve and its applications, as well as understand how changing the threshold of decision in a predictor impacts the outcome.
