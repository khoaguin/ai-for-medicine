# AI for Medical Diagnosis
![](./images/banner.png)
In the first course of the specialization, we will learn about building machine learning models for diagnosis - an activity of identifying diseases. We will build an algorithm that will look at a chest X-ray and determine whether it contains disease. We'll also build another algorithm that will try to identify locations of tumors by looking at brain MRIs.
