## Courses, Labs and Assignments
### [Course 1 - AI for Medical Diagnosis](./ai-for-medical-diagnosis/)
In the first course, we will learn about building machine learning models for diagnosis - an activity of identifying diseases. We will build an algorithm that will look at a chest X-ray and determine whether it contains disease. We'll also build another algorithm that will try to identify locations of tumors by looking at brain MRIs.
