Welcome to my repo for the [AI for Medicine Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine) by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). Here you will find my notes, labs and assignments for the specialization. 

## About this Specialization
AI has many practical applications in medicine, for example helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, making predictions about patientsâ€™ future health, and recommend better treatments. In this specialization, we will

## Courses, Labs and Assignments
### [Course 1 - AI for Medical Diagnosis](./ai-for-medical-diagnosis/)
In the first course of the specialization, we will learn about building machine learning models for diagnosis - an activity of identifying diseases. We will build an algorithm that will look at a chest X-ray and determine whether it contains disease. We'll also build another algorithm that will try to identify locations of tumors by looking at brain MRIs.
